# UFOs
## Overview of Project 
We are helping Dana build a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time once we click the HTML file. In addition to the date, we added a table filters for the city, state, country, and shape. 

## Results 
In the website, people can look for specific information by using the filter instead of scrolling through the data. 

## Summary 
The data was very limited in regards to the UFO information. It is nice to find hte state, country, shape, and extra comments but it would ahve been nice to see an in-depth description of the sightings.
